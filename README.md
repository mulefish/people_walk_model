The orange balls are 'people'. They have some behaviour; the will cluster around  
one of the letters.  The file 'look.py' will attempt to determine which letter is  
most popular. 

# run it
node server  
localhost:3000/
Take screen shot 
Feed screen shot to look.py 

# Agents: 
The orange balls will wonder around but each one has an opinion about the best  
letter and will be attracted to it. 

# look.py
Python to take a .png and find the most popular letter in the supplied image...      
Next up? Maybe do this as a series of screen shots to get the idea of 'time'...     

# Findings with this image: 
python3 look.py   
The most popular letter is: B
